# Sign-up Form
In this project I'm gonna build a Sign-up form to show my new knowledge on forms, form styling and validation.

This project is part from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) and the first one from Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.

## [LIVE PREVIEW](https://bast1ann.github.io/sign-up-form/)

## Key Objectives
* Apply new concepts on forms, their styling and validation.
* Apply and understand regex to validate the password, so it is at least 8 characters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter and 1 digit.
* Validate passwords so they coincide with each other.
* Showing clear instructions for the user about what to put into the inputs.
